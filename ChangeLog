	* first version: maintain kalign; assume histogram per sample (must be normalised)
	* Desiderata: 
		- use location information (relies on BAM/reference)
		- consider canonical form
		- single k-mer may represent error (think Bloom filter); does QC remove these reads?
		- alternative to location information can be flanking k-mers
		- exclude reads beginning or ending with homopolymer (since true size may span another read)
		- therefore it can limit to homopolymers between two 4mers;
