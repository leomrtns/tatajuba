	* beta version working: 
		1. imports BWA and gives for each tract a location in reference genome. (BWA creates indices from ref fasta)
		2. merge tracts from same genome based on similarity and location
	* TODO:
		1. needs annotated genome; therefore user gives GFF, we generate the ref fasta that will then be used for bwa indexing
		2. aim is to distinguish tracts by their effects on sample; therefore we need to keep track of (a) coding effect (i.e. 
		if tract is on coding region or not); and (b) change in length from reference

	* Andrew's hints:
		1. if program is slow, we can first map context-mers to a reference and exclude those not in homopolymer tracts; 
		2. check Illumina limits for homopolymers, it might exclude > 10 or something
		3. indeed good idea to exclude unique context-mers (Bloom filter)
		4. Always aim at "one-click" software: run without options and get a useful, interpretable result

	* first version: maintain kalign; assume histogram per sample (must be normalised)
	* Desiderata: 
		- use location information (relies on BAM/reference): not possible now, but keep in mind that we'll need to locate these changes on reference genome
		- consider canonical form
		- single k-mer may represent error (think Bloom filter); does QC remove these reads?
		- alternative to location information can be flanking k-mers
		- exclude reads beginning or ending with homopolymer (since true size may span another read)
		- therefore it can limit to homopolymers between two 4mers;
